# sElect -- Secure Election

sElect is a remote electronic voting system designed to provide 
**privacy** and **verifiability** (but not coercion resistance).

One of our goal is to establish the privacy property on the
**implementation level** (code level). The code-level
verification of sElect is carried out within the DFG Priority
Programme *Reliably Secure Software Systems* (RS3)
(https://www.spp-rs3.de).

The core of the system is written in Java, while, in the current
version, the applications built on top of the core are written in
node.js.

*This is still work in progress.*
